# Position Based Fluid

***

## Overview

This is an OpenGL project built to simulate fluid with position based dynamics.

## Usage

Clone this repo recursively with submodules as this project includes dependencies from other repositories.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/hyt589/PositionBasedFluid-OpenGL.git
```

## Notes

This project is still a work in progress.

### TODOS

- Implement PBR shaders for rendering
- Implement position based fluid
- (stretch goal) Implement global illumination using Voxel Cone Tracing
